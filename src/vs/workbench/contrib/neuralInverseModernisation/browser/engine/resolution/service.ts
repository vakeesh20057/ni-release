/**
 * # ISourceResolutionService — Public Interface
 *
 * The Source Resolution Service solves the **COBOL wall problem** — and its equivalent
 * in every other legacy language — by expanding all external dependency references
 * inline before the AI ever sees the code.
 *
 * ## The COBOL Wall Problem (and why it matters for every language)
 *
 * When a COBOL program contains `COPY CUSTMAST`, the AI sees only the reference.
 * The 40 field definitions inside CUSTMAST are invisible. The AI cannot reason
 * about data types, business rules, or field meanings because they live in a
 * separate file.
 *
 * The same problem exists in every language:
 * - COBOL: COPY copybook / CALL 'PROGRAM'
 * - PL/SQL: v_balance accounts.balance%TYPE / pkg_billing.calc_late_fee(...)
 * - Java EE: @EJB UserSessionBean userBean
 * - RPG: /COPY QRPGLESRC/CUSTHEADR / CALL 'GLPGM'
 * - NATURAL: USING DA-CUSTOMER / CALLNAT 'VALCUST'
 * - TypeScript: import { AccountService } from './AccountService'
 *
 * ## How Resolution Works
 *
 * For COBOL (and similar flat-file inclusion languages):
 *   The entire text of the copybook is expanded inline, replacing the COPY statement.
 *   The AI sees one unified source with all fields defined.
 *
 * For languages with structured type systems (Java, TypeScript, PL/SQL packages):
 *   Interface context comments are injected — showing method signatures, purpose,
 *   risk level, and translation status — without producing invalid code.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * ```
 * Discovery (Phase 0)
 *     └─► KB unit created with status='pending', sourceText set, resolvedSource=''
 *
 * Resolution (Phase 1) ← This service
 *     └─► batchResolve() → resolveUnit() per unit → kb.resolveUnitSource()
 *         └─► KB unit.resolvedSource filled, status transitions pending→ready
 *
 * Fingerprinting (Phase 3)
 *     └─► FingerprintService reads unit.resolvedSource (the expanded source)
 *         └─► L1 + L2 extraction on the complete, self-contained text
 *
 * Translation (Phase 4)
 *     └─► Translation agent reads unit.resolvedSource via kb.getResolvedContext()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Resolve all pending units in the active KB session:
 * ```ts
 * const summary = await resolutionService.batchResolve();
 * console.log(`Resolved ${summary.fullyResolved}/${summary.totalUnits} units`);
 * ```
 *
 * Resolve a single unit by ID:
 * ```ts
 * const result = await resolutionService.resolveUnit(unitId);
 * if (result.outcome === 'resolved' || result.outcome === 'partial') {
 *   // resolvedSource is now available in the KB
 * }
 * ```
